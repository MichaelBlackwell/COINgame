flavor = "The Emperor demands spice tribute; Houses jockey for favor, while Fremen and other subversive forces may see an opportunity in the tribute chaos."
description = "Event Option A: The House that pays the largest spice levy to the Emperor gains temporary Imperial favor (maybe resources or the ability to use Sardaukar forces).
Event Option B: If no one pays up, or if the tribute is insufficient, the Emperor punishes the planet with a crackdown—Troops loyal to the Emperor enforce martial law in targeted regions."
