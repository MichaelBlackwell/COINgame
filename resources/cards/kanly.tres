flavor = "Formalized House vendettas present a chance to strike or sabotage an enemy with less fear of political fallout."
description = "Event Option A: One House targets another with sabotage—destroying a certain number of resources or blocking an action. The sabotage is “sanctioned” by the Emperor or the Landsraad, so there’s no immediate reprisal.
Event Option B: If the targeted House has enough political sway, they can rally allies (or Sardaukar intervention) to protect themselves and turn the vendetta into a diplomatic victory."
